# YOLO Flutter App Development Progress

## Session Date: 2025-01-08

### Branch: feat/sample-applications

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Label Loading Improvements
Fixed label loading issues across all native predictor classes to ensure class names display correctly instead of "Unknown".

#### Changes Made:
- **Segmenter.kt**: 
  - Added `YOLOFileUtils.loadLabelsFromAppendedZip` as primary label loading method
  - Falls back to FlatBuffers metadata if ZIP approach fails
  - Fixed compilation error (break in lambda replaced with return@fileLoop)
  
- **PoseEstimator.kt**:
  - Added same two-step label loading approach
  - Added MappedByteBuffer import
  - Added loadLabelsFromFlatbuffers helper method
  
- **ObbDetector.kt**:
  - Added same two-step label loading approach  
  - Added MappedByteBuffer import
  - Added loadLabelsFromFlatbuffers helper method
  
- **Classifier.kt**:
  - Updated to use YOLOFileUtils.loadLabelsFromAppendedZip
  - Added fallback to FlatBuffers metadata
  - Added MappedByteBuffer import
  - Added loadLabelsFromFlatbuffers helper method

#### Result:
All predictors now successfully load labels from model files. Segmentation sample confirmed working with proper class names (person, sports ball, tennis racket).

### 2. Classification Sample Fixes
Fixed type casting issues in the classification sample app.

#### Issues Fixed:
- Changed from accessing `result['probs']` to `result['classification']`
- Fixed `_Map<Object?, Object?>` type cast error using `Map.from()`
- Updated to parse `top5Classes` and `top5Confidences` arrays

#### Result:
Classification sample now properly displays top predictions without crashes.

### 3. OBB Sample Fixes
Fixed multiple issues in the OBB (Oriented Bounding Box) detection sample.

#### Issues Fixed:
- Replaced non-existent `Icons.confidence` with `Icons.assessment`
- Fixed coordinate scaling - OBB points are already normalized (0-1)
- Removed incorrect double scaling with scaleX/scaleY
- Fixed label positioning to use correct coordinates
- Added debug logging to verify data reception

#### Current Status:
- OBB sample compiles and runs
- Uses CustomPaint to draw OBB polygons on Dart side (for debugging native output)
- Debug logging added to verify data structure

## Current Issues to Investigate

1. **OBB Visualization**: Fixed drawing logic to use OBB data directly from rawResults
   - Added extensive debug logging to trace data flow
   - Fixed coordinate scaling (OBB points are normalized 0-1)
   - Drawing now uses OBB data directly instead of trying to match with detections
   - Added angle display from OBB data

2. **Debug Output**: Added console logging for:
   - Canvas and image sizes
   - Number of detections and OBB items
   - Individual OBB drawing operations

## Next Steps

1. Test OBB sample with actual OBB model to verify drawing
2. Remove debug logging once visualization is confirmed working
3. Complete any remaining sample apps if needed
4. Final testing of all samples on both Android and iOS

## Git Status
- All changes committed and pushed to `feat/sample-applications` branch
- Latest commit: Added debug logging to OBB sample

## Important Notes
- All samples use CustomPaint for drawing detections (not using native annotatedImage)
- This allows verification of native numerical output
- Label loading now works consistently across all task types
