/// Configuration class for customizing YOLO streaming behavior.
///
/// This class allows fine-grained control over what data is included in
/// real-time YOLO detection streams. It provides options to balance
/// performance with data richness based on application needs.
///
/// Example usage:
/// ```dart
/// // Lightweight configuration for high FPS
/// final lightConfig = YOLOStreamingConfig.lightweight();
///
/// // Detailed configuration with all data
/// final detailedConfig = YOLOStreamingConfig.detailed();
///
/// // Custom configuration
/// final customConfig = YOLOStreamingConfig.custom(
///   includeOriginalImage: true,
///   maxFPS: 20,
///   includeMasks: false,
/// );
/// ```
class YOLOStreamingConfig {
  /// Whether to include basic detection results (bounding boxes, confidence, class).
  /// 
  /// This is the core YOLO output and is typically always enabled.
  /// Disabling this will result in no detection data being sent.
  final bool includeDetections;

  /// Whether to include classification results.
  ///
  /// Relevant for classify tasks. When enabled, classification scores
  /// are included in the streaming results.
  final bool includeClassifications;

  /// Whether to include processing time metrics in milliseconds.
  ///
  /// This provides timing information for performance monitoring.
  /// Default is true to maintain compatibility with existing apps.
  final bool includeProcessingTimeMs;

  /// Whether to include frames per second (FPS) metrics.
  ///
  /// This provides real-time FPS information for performance monitoring.
  /// Default is true to maintain compatibility with existing apps.
  final bool includeFps;

  /// Whether to include segmentation masks in the results.
  ///
  /// Only relevant for segmentation tasks. Masks can be memory-intensive
  /// and may impact performance on lower-end devices.
  final bool includeMasks;

  /// Whether to include pose estimation keypoints.
  ///
  /// Only relevant for pose estimation tasks. Includes keypoint coordinates
  /// and confidence scores for detected poses.
  final bool includePoses;

  /// Whether to include oriented bounding box (OBB) data.
  ///
  /// Only relevant for OBB detection tasks. Includes rotated bounding box
  /// coordinates and angles.
  final bool includeOBB;

  /// Whether to include annotated images with drawn detections.
  ///
  /// Annotated images show bounding boxes, labels, and confidence scores
  /// drawn on the original image. This can be memory-intensive.
  final bool includeAnnotatedImage;

  /// Whether to include original camera frames without annotations.

  /// This significantly increases memory usage and should be used carefully.
